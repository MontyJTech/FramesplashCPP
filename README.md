# Framesplash
## Overview

Framesplash is my own C++ implementation of Jozsef Fejes' [Rainbow Smoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvFsB4SLhA) algorithm. 
In this project, I built upon Fejes' original idea of 'painting' the full 8-bit colour spectrum onto a canvas by placing each colour pixel next to it's closest neighbours. 

## Features

- Custom colour palette generation via video/ image input preprocessing. 
- Perlin noise generation and integration. 
- Multi-thread processing.
- Custom 'shape' templating.
